    "# EEG and Behavioral Data Integration Pipeline for Joint Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This script integrates **preprocessed EEG data** (in BIDS format) with **trial-level behavioral responses** to generate a unified dataset for joint modeling. It extracts **multiverse neural features**—including trial-wise and bins-level ERP. For each level analysis, we calculate **amplitude (AMS, PAMS) and build-up rate (SLPS)**. These features are then merged with behavioral variables (e.g., reaction time, accuracy) on a **trial-by-trial basis**, normalized within subjects, and structured for joint modeling.\n",

    "# Code Walkthrough: EEG–Behavior Integration and Feature Engineering\n",
    "This script processes data from 20 subjects to extract trial-level neural features, align them with behavior, and prepare a clean, analysis-ready dataset. Below is a step-by-step explanation of the code flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Configuration and Directory Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key directories are defined:\n",
    "  - `PREPROCESSED_DATA_ROOT`: Path to BIDS-formatted EEG data (after preprocessing).\n",
    "  - `PROJECT_ROOT`: Base project directory.\n",
    "  - Three subdirectories under `results/` are created:\n",
    "    - `epoch/`: Stores raw epoched EEG data (in volts).\n",
    "    - `erp/`: Stores channel-reduced ERP matrices.\n",
    "    - `joint-modeling/`: Stores the final merged dataset.\n",
    "- **Time windows** are specified relative to the **response event** (t = 0):\n",
    "  - `ERP_TMIN = –1.0`, `ERP_TMAX = 0.2`: Full window for ERP visualization and quality control.\n",
    "  - `T_AMS_SLPS = [–0.18, –0.08]`: Pre-response window for preparatory activity.\n",
    "  - `T_PAMS = [–0.05, 0.05]`: Peri-response window for motor peak detection.\n",
    "- **ROI channel indices** `[54, 36, 86]` are selected to focus analysis on a functionally relevant scalp region.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Load and Validate Behavioral Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The behavioral file (`behaviorData_low_1_final.csv`) is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "- It is assumed that the **first column contains subject IDs** in the format `'A001'`, `'A002'`, etc.\n",
    "- A quick summary prints the number of trials and columns to confirm successful loading.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Subject-Level Processing Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the 20 subjects (`sub-A001` to `sub-A020`):\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. **Extract subject-specific behavioral trials**\n",
    "- Filter `behavior_df` to include only rows matching the current subject (e.g., `'A001'`).\n",
    "- Assert that at least one trial exists; otherwise, raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. **Load EEG data and extract response events**\n",
    "- The EEG file (`.vhdr`) is loaded using `mne.io.read_raw_brainvision`.\n",
    "- MNE’s annotation system parses event markers; the **response event** is identified as `'Stimulus/S  5'`.\n",
    "- **Critical validation**: The number of EEG response events **must exactly match** the number of behavioral trials. If not, the script halts with an assertion error—ensuring no misalignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. **Epoch full ERP window**\n",
    "- EEG data is epoched from **–1.0 s to +0.2 s** relative to response onset.\n",
    "- The resulting `Epochs` object is validated to ensure trial count integrity.\n",
    "- Raw epoched data (converted from µV to V) is saved as a `.mat` file for potential re-use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### d. **Compute group ERP for visualization**\n",
    "- ERP is computed by averaging across the three ROI channels and all trials.\n",
    "- This per-subject average ERP is appended to a list (`erp_across_subjects`) for later group-level plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### e. **Extract trial-level neural features**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### i. **AMS (Average Motor Signal)**\n",
    "- Epochs data in the **pre-response window** (–180 to –80 ms).\n",
    "- For each trial, average across ROI channels and time → yields a single **AMS value per trial**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii. **PAMS (Peak Amplitude of Motor Signal)**\n",
    "- Epochs data in the **peri-response window** (–50 to +50 ms).\n",
    "- For each trial, take the **maximum amplitude** across time (after averaging channels) → **PAMS per trial**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### iii. **SLPS (Slope of Preparatory Signal)**\n",
    "- Same pre-response window as AMS.\n",
    "- For each trial:\n",
    "  1. Average across ROI channels → 1D time series.\n",
    "  2. Apply a **smoothing function** (`smooth()`) to reduce noise.\n",
    "  3. Fit a **linear regression** (slope = SLPS) over the smoothed segment.\n",
    "- This captures the **rate of neural buildup** before response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### f. **Merge neural features with behavior**\n",
    "- A DataFrame `features_df` contains `ams`, `pams`, `slps` (one row per trial).\n",
    "- It is concatenated with the subject’s behavioral data.\n",
    "- A `subj` column is added for downstream grouping.\n",
    "- This combined DataFrame is appended to `joint_modeling_dfs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Aggregate and Normalize Across Subjects**\n",
    "\n",
    "After processing all subjects:\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. **Combine all trials into one DataFrame**\n",
    "- `pd.concat(joint_modeling_dfs)` creates `joint_full` with one row per trial (~20 subjects × hundreds of trials).\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. **Subject-level quantile binning (on original values)**\n",
    "- For each neural feature (`ams`, `pams`, `slps`), trials are grouped by subject and split into **4 quantile bins** (1st to 4th quartile).\n",
    "- A safety check ensures binning only occurs if sufficient variability exists; otherwise, `'N/A'` is assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. **Within-subject z-scoring (on original values)**\n",
    "- Each feature is **standardized per subject**:  \n",
    "  `z = (x – mean) / std`\n",
    "- This removes subject-specific offsets, making features comparable across individuals—critical for pooling data in linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### d. **Compute bin means of z-scored features**\n",
    "- For each subject and quantile bin, the **mean z-score** is computed.\n",
    "- This mean is **broadcast back to every trial** in that bin, creating new columns (`ams_bin`, `pams_bin`, `slp_bin`).\n",
    "- Enables analyses comparing behavioral outcomes across **neural bins** (e.g., “Do trials in the top SLPS bin have faster RTs?”).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. **Final Output and Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The final DataFrame `joint_full` is saved as `joint_modeling_all.csv`.\n",
    "- A summary prints total trial count and number of unique subjects.\n",
    "- **Final check**: Confirms that all 20 expected subjects are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. **ERP Visualization Helper**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `plot_erp_results()` function is defined to visualize **group-average ERP** with **±SEM shading**.\n",
    "- It assumes input `erp` is shape `(n_subjects, n_timepoints)`.\n",
    "- **Note**: The call at the bottom (`plot_erp_results(test_plot, ...)`) appears to be a **debug artifact**—`test_plot` is not defined in the pipeline and should be removed or guarded in production.\n"
